                <p>At a cheering competition, the crowd's clamor is incredible.
                    Every cheer and stunt demonstrates the team's diligence and commitment.
                    Nothing compares to the feeling of adrenaline that comes from playing on stage.<br>
                    <br>
                    What makes competition so unique is the support and friendship between teammates.
                    Winning is wonderful, but the trip and the relationships made along the way are the real winners.

                <p>Like stars, true friends are always present, even when you can't see them.
                     When you stumble, a good friend helps you get back up and joins you in celebrating your victories.
                      The finest medicine is laughter, especially when it is shared with a friend.

                    <p>On a chilly night, the warmth of a family's love is like a cozy blanket.
                        A family's ties are strengthened when members share stories and laugh together.
                        You can be yourself, flaws and all, and still be accepted in a family.
                        
                        My love for my family always feels close, no matter how far away we are.
